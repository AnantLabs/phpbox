					phpBox is a small and lightweight everyday-assistant if it comes to PHP development.<br />
					If you are familiar with PHP, you know there is neither a GUI nor any simple way to execute your script just for two lines of code. <br />
					The idea for such a small and simple helper started somewhere around 2008 here at GEDAK. <br />
					I, Lars, write PHP scripts for nearly every task. <br />
					Even if there are 200 files to be renamed in a special, not common definable/renameable way, I pop off an UltraEdit? <br />
					instance and write some lines of PHP to solve the task. In 2008, Armin, a work mate of mine, wrote me PHPrun. <br />
					It solved my problems very well but left some space for improvement. Sadly he left the company to reach out for more (and less coding ;-) )
