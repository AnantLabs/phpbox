					phpBox is a small and lightweight everyday-assistant if it comes to PHP development.
					If you are familiar with PHP, you know there is neither a GUI nor any simple way to execute your script just for two lines of code.
					The idea for such a small and simple helper started somewhere around 2008 here at GEDAK.
					I, Lars, write PHP scripts for nearly every task.
					Even if there are 200 files to be renamed in a special, not common definable/renameable way, I pop off an UltraEdit?
					instance and write some lines of PHP to solve the task. In 2008, Armin, a work mate of mine, wrote me PHPrun.
					It solved my problems very well but left some space for improvement. Sadly he left the company to reach out for more (and less coding ;-) )
